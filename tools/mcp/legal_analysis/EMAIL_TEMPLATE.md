**Subject:** State v. [CLIENT_INITIALS] - Discovery Review

Hi [Prosecutor Name],

I've had a chance to review the discovery in the [CLIENT_INITIALS] [case type] case (Cause [CASE_NUM]).

[LEAD WITH 1-2 STRONGEST ISSUES - Keep it brief and conversational]:

**Example for strong suppression issue:**
The reasonable suspicion for the stop looks pretty thin under State v. Prado. The report notes [specific basis] but there's [weakness in the documentation]. That's going to be a tough sell for RS.

**Example for breath test issue:**
The observation period on the breath test appears to be [X] minutes based on the documented times. WAC 448-14 requires 15, so we're looking at a potential suppression issue there.

**Example for Miranda issue:**
The Miranda advisement timing is going to be problematic - [CLIENT] made statements about [subject] before any warnings were given, and those look pretty clearly custodial under the circumstances.

[CLOSING - Collaborative but confident]:

I know these cases are fact-specific, but wanted to touch base early. Happy to chat about whether there's a reasonable resolution that makes sense for everyone.

[OR if stronger position]:

I'm confident in our position here, but always open to having a conversation if you think there's a reasonable path forward.

[OR if more negotiation-focused]:

[CLIENT] is interested in resolving this efficiently if there's a reasonable path. Worth a quick call?

Let me know if you want to discuss.

Thanks,  
Tony
