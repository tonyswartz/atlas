Hey everyone, Tony here. This week, I put my son in daycare. He cried. I cried. And then we both got influenza A.

I'm Tony, and this is 832 Weekends, where I'm documenting the middle of parenting—figuring it out as I go, not from a position of wisdom, but from the messiness of actually being there.

Last Monday morning, we walked into his new classroom. The teacher was warm and capable—she'd been doing this for fifteen years. My son clung to my leg. I tried to sound confident when I said, "Let's go find your cubby!" but my voice cracked. He looked up at me with that trust kids have, the kind that says you're going to protect them. And then I had to untangle his fingers from my pants and walk out while he screamed "Dada, DADA, DADA" like I was abandoning him. Which, honestly, I felt like I was.

I've been thinking about the word "choice" a lot this week. We chose this. My wife and I sat down, did the math, weighed the options, and decided this was right for our family. It was a deliberate decision. And yet, standing in that parking lot after drop-off, crying in my car before I even started driving to work, I didn't feel like I'd made a choice. I felt like I'd failed.

There's this narrative we tell ourselves about parenting—that if we're doing it right, our kids should be happy. Protected. Safe from the hard things. And I know that's a myth. I know that. I've read the books. I understand that resilience is built through struggle, that independence requires separation, that kids need to learn the world doesn't revolve around them. Intellectually, I get all of it. But standing at that classroom door, watching my son reach for me while I walked away? Intellectually didn't matter. All that mattered was the sound of his crying and the knowledge that I was the one causing it.

The first three days were brutal. He screamed every morning. The teachers assured us it was normal—"separation anxiety is developmental, it's healthy, it means he has a secure attachment to you." And some part of me thought, well, that's great for his developmental milestones, but could he maybe develop them a little less loudly? I went home those days and sat at my computer, unable to focus, waiting for updates from the teachers. "He calmed down after ten minutes." "He's eating well." "He fell asleep for nap." Each message was a small relief, but also a small wound—because it proved he didn't actually need me. He would be fine. Which is what I wanted, but also somehow felt like rejection.

And then, on day five, he got sick. Fever of 102. Congestion. That deep, chest cough that makes you wince just hearing it. The pediatrician confirmed it: influenza A. My wife and I looked at each other across our sick toddler, both of us running on broken sleep and cold medicine and guilt-soaked coffee, and I could feel the narrative forming. See? This is what happens. You put him in daycare, he gets sick immediately, his immune system is overwhelmed, and now he's suffering. You made the wrong choice. This is your fault.

But here's what I'm learning to sit with: he was going to get sick eventually. Kids in group settings get sick—it's how their immune systems build. If we'd kept him home, we also wouldn't have been able to work, and the financial stress would have seeped into our patience, into our presence, into the quality of time we actually had with him. There's no version of this where he doesn't get sick eventually. There's only the version where we pretend we're protecting him by keeping him isolated, when really we're just protecting ourselves from the guilt of watching him struggle.

We have 832 weekends from birth to age 18. I've done 78 of them so far. That means I have 754 more to figure things out. And one thing I'm starting to realize is that most of the decisions in parenting aren't between good and bad. They're between hard and hard. Between what he needs and what I need. Between my comfort and his growth. Between the guilt of leaving and the guilt of staying.

I don't know if this daycare choice is the right one. I don't know if he'll look back someday and understand why we made it. But I know that we're not choosing convenience over his wellbeing—we're choosing sustainability over burnout, presence over resentment, a family that can actually show up for him rather than a family that's so depleted by the effort of doing everything ourselves that we have nothing left to give.

This week, I'm trying to sit with the discomfort of not knowing. To let the guilt be there without letting it make the decisions. Because I think maybe the point isn't to never make hard choices. I think the point is to make them anyway, and then to be there when it's over—when he reaches for me at pickup, when he tells me about his friends, when he eventually, hopefully, remembers this as the place where he learned to be without me, so he could learn to come back.

I'm Tony. This is 832 Weekends. Thanks for being here.
