Hi [Prosecutor Name],

I've had a chance to review the discovery in the AFF DUI case (Cause #: [CASE_NUM_001]).

A couple of issues jumped out that I wanted to flag before we get too far down the road:

First, the reasonable suspicion for the stop looks pretty thin under State v. Prado. The report notes "weaving within lane" as the sole basis, but there's only one instance documented with no other concerning factors. That's going to be a tough sell for RS.

Second, the observation period on the breath test appears to clock in at 14 minutes based on the times documented. WAC 448-14 requires 15, so we'd be looking at a suppression issue there as well.

I know these cases are always fact-specific, but wanted to touch base early. Happy to chat about whether there's a reasonable resolution that makes sense for everyone.

Let me know if you want to discuss.

Thanks,  
Tony

**✏️ Before Sending:**
- [ ] Replace AFF with actual client initials
- [ ] Replace [Prosecutor Name] with actual name  
- [ ] Replace [CASE_NUM_001] with actual case number
- [ ] Review tone - adjust formality based on relationship
- [ ] Consider: Is this the right time to send? (Early in case = yes)

**💡 Strategic Notes:**
- Leading with strongest issue (Prado RS violation)
- Mentioning second issue for additional leverage
- Framing as "early touch base" not ultimatum
- Leaving door open for resolution
- Professional but conversational tone
