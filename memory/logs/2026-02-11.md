## Events & Notes

- 19:16 [insight] Tony shared a key insight about managing his solo DUI practice via WIP limits on Kanban: **WIP Limit Philosophy**: He uses WIP (Work In Progress) limits to prevent overextension, which he recognizes creates case backlog that's hard to escape. The "ideal" non-settled case count is a key metric. **Recent Example**: 2 weeks ago, he noticed he'd taken on more new cases than usual. He proactively paused consultations for 2 weeks to work through close-to-done cases. **Revenue Paradox Insight**: He initially worried pausing consultations would lose revenue — but the pause was actually *necessary because* he'd exceeded his revenue goals. More new cases doesn't mean more revenue; it means more competing demands that slow everything down. **Solo Practitioner Challenge**: His natural human inclination is to accept anything that comes his way, but this has never worked positively for him. Solo practitioners often conflate "being busy" with "being successful," but for substantive legal work, overextension is the opposite of success. **Key Takeaway**: WIP limits force the pause decision objectively rather than waiting until burnout forces it. Closing cases generates revenue, not opening new ones. #practice-management
