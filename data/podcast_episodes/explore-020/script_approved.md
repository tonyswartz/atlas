So here's something I've been thinking about lately. We just got back from Portugal - our first big trip with the baby, which is its own adventure - and I planned most of it using ChatGPT. And I gotta say, I'm genuinely surprised by how well it worked. Not perfect, but way better than I expected.

Now, I'm not an early adopter of everything. I remember trying to use AI for trip planning a few years ago, and it was basically useless. It'd tell me restaurants that closed, museums with wrong hours, stuff that was just... wrong. So I went into this trip expecting more of the same. But here's what happened.

I typed something like, "Plan a week in Portugal with a nine-month-old, we like food and walking around, don't need touristy stuff." And within seconds I had this solid framework. It suggested Lisbon, Porto, maybe Sintra. It told me which neighborhoods were stroller-friendly, which museums had baby changing stations, where to find good pastéis de nata at 8 AM. Little things that would've taken me hours to Google.

That's the part that blew me away. The speed. I could ask follow-up questions like I was talking to a travel friend. "What about train rides between cities? Is that doable with a baby?" And it'd adjust. "Oh yeah, the Alfa Pendular from Lisbon to Porto is about two and a half hours, first class has more space, here's what to expect." That kind of thing.

But here's the thing - it wasn't perfect. Far from it. It told me one museum was open on Sundays when it wasn't. It recommended a restaurant that, according to recent reviews, has gone downhill. It gave me a walking route in Porto that, honestly, would've been fine but was definitely not the most scenic option. I caught maybe three or four factual errors just in my research phase.

So here's my honest assessment: I'd rate the experience about eight out of ten. It got me eighty percent of the way there. It saved me probably ten hours of digging around online. But that last twenty percent? That's where you still need a human. You need to double-check the opening hours, read recent reviews, maybe hit up a travel forum or two.

And honestly? I think that's the sweet spot. Use it as your research assistant, not your travel guru. Ask it for frameworks, not final answers. "Give me three neighborhood options in Lisbon for families" - great. "Tell me the exact opening hours of this specific attraction" - verify that yourself.

If you're thinking about trying it for your next trip, here's what I'd suggest. Be specific. The more context you give, the better. Tell it about your travel style, your budget, who you're traveling with. And treat the first output as a rough draft, not a final plan. Ask follow-up questions. Challenge it. "Is there a quieter neighborhood than this?" "What's a local restaurant off the tourist path?"

The technology has come so far even just in the last couple years. It's not replacing the magic of discovering a place yourself, but it's become a pretty incredible starting point. For me, it took the overwhelm out of planning with a baby. And honestly, that alone was worth it.

Next time you plan a trip, give it a shot. See what it comes up with, then go verify the parts that matter. Links to the exact prompts I used for Portugal are in the show notes. Until next time, keep exploring.
