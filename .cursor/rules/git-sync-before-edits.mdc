# Git Sync Before Edits

At the **start of a new chat** (before making edits or reviewing files), sync the workspace with the remote:

1. **Pull** to get the latest from remote:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   ```
   (Use `git pull` if you prefer merge; `--rebase` keeps history linear.)

2. **Push** if there are local commits that haven’t been pushed:
   ```bash
   git status
   # If ahead of origin, run:
   git push
   ```

Run these in the project root. If pull has conflicts or push is rejected, report that to the user before changing files. After sync (or after reporting a sync problem), proceed with the requested edits or review.
