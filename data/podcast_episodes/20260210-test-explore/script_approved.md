There's a moment in every hike when the trail disappears, and you're left standing in the middle of nowhere with nothing but thick old-growth forest around you and the sinking realization that you have absolutely no idea where you are. That exact moment? It's where the best stories begin.

I'd been hiking for three days straight in Olympic National Park, and I was exhausted in that good way—like my muscles had been properly used, like my brain had finally quieted down. I was supposed to be on the Hoh River Trail, this famous route through the Hoh Rain Forest where the moss hangs from the trees like green curtains and every surface is slick with moisture. Beautiful, predictable, well-marked.

But here's the thing about well-marked trails: they don't often surprise you.

On my third morning, I woke up before dawn, and instead of continuing north toward Blue Glacier, I found myself staring at a game trail that branched off near a particularly thick grove of western red cedars. The main path continued straight. This one went uphill, disappearing into a tunnel of ferns and salal.

Now, I'm not normally someone who strays from marked trails. I'm the person who checks the weather obsessively, who brings extra layers, who tells someone exactly where I'm going before I leave. But there was something about that early morning light hitting the moss at just the right angle, and the absolute silence except for the distant sound of the river, and I just... went.

Big mistake? I thought so at first.

The game trail lasted about twenty minutes before it didn't exist anymore. Just suddenly, there was no trail. Just thick underbrush and fallen logs and the kind of quiet that feels heavy. I tried to retrace my steps, but nothing looks the same from a different direction, and the forest has a way of swallowing paths whole. By the time the sun was properly up, I was genuinely lost. My water bottle was half-full. My phone had zero bars. I sat down on a mossy rock and laughed, because what else do you do?

And that's when I heard it.

Water. Not a river, not a creek—something bigger. The sound was coming from somewhere up the slope, this deep, consistent roar that didn't match any tributary I'd seen on my map. I stood up, and I started walking toward it.

Forty-five minutes later, I broke through a wall of sword ferns and encountered what I can only describe as the most beautiful thing I've seen in my entire life. A waterfall, probably forty feet tall, pouring over a basalt column into a pool the color of liquid jade. The sunlight was hitting the mist at exactly the right angle, and there was a double rainbow hovering right at the base. The sound was thunderous and soothing at the same time. I sat on a moss-covered boulder at the edge of that pool and just... existed.

I stayed there for two hours. I didn't take many photos—honestly, none of them captured it. I just watched the water change as clouds moved across the sun. I found myself thinking about how easy it would have been to just stay on the main trail, to have had a perfectly nice, predictable hike to Blue Glacier and back. I would have missed this entirely. I would have never known it existed.

On my way out, I found the actual trail again—not more than a quarter mile from where I'd originally branched off. I'd been so close to turning back. That's what gets me. The adventure almost didn't happen because I almost made the safe choice.

If Olympic National Park is on your list, here are three things that made my trip infinitely better.

First, download the Gaia GPS app before you go. Cell service is essentially nonexistent in most of the park, and having offline maps saved me more than once. I downloaded the entire park's topographic data, and while I still managed to get temporarily lost, I at least knew which direction the nearest trailhead was.

Second, bring gaiters. I cannot tell you how many times I was grateful for my dirty-girl gaiters. The Hoh Rain Forest is wet, and the mud isn't like regular mud—it's thick and slick and it will pull your shoes right off your feet. Gaiters kept me moving when other hikers were slipping and sliding.

Third, and this is the most important one: pack more food than you think you need. I brought two energy bars for a full-day hike and was starving by noon. The Hoh Rain Forest burns calories differently than other places—there are no views to rest your eyes on, just constant concentration on footing and direction. Your body works harder than you expect.

Links to everything I mentioned are in the show notes.

The irony of getting lost is that sometimes it's the only way to actually find something. That waterfall isn't on any official map I can find. It's not Instagram-famous. It exists only for the people willing to step off the marked path and trust that somewhere, water is still falling. Next time you're on a trail and you see a questionable branch in the road, I dare you to take it.
