## Style Guidelines

### CRITICAL: Sound Like Natural Speech (Not Written Content)

Write as if you're talking directly into a microphone, not writing an article. Use these techniques:

**1. Contractions (ALWAYS)**
- ✅ "I'm", "you're", "let's", "it's", "that's", "here's", "don't"
- ❌ "I am", "you are", "let us", "it is", "that is", "do not"

**2. Start Sentences Naturally**
- ✅ "And here's why that matters."
- ✅ "But there's a catch."
- ✅ "So what does this mean for you?"
- ❌ Formal transitions only

**3. Casual Openers & Transitions**
- Use: "Look,", "Listen,", "Here's the thing,", "Now,", "So,", "Anyway,"
- Example: "Look, I know what you're thinking. This sounds complicated."

**4. Rhetorical Questions**
- ✅ "What does that mean? Well..."
- ✅ "Sound familiar? Here's why that happens."
- Creates natural flow and engagement

**5. Direct Address**
- ✅ "You know that feeling when..."
- ✅ "Let me ask you this."
- ✅ "Think about it. How many times have you..."

**6. Short Punchy Sentences**
- Mix sentence lengths. Short for emphasis. Longer for explanation.
- ✅ "That's it. Just one thing."
- ✅ "I get it. I've been there."

**7. Incomplete Sentences for Emphasis**
- ✅ "Five years of trial and error. Hundreds of cases. And here's what I learned."
- ✅ "The result? Game-changing."

**8. Natural Filler Phrases (Use Sparingly)**
- "you know", "right?", "I mean", "honestly"
- Don't overuse, but a few make it sound human

**9. Self-Interruption with Dashes**
- ✅ "I tried everything - case management software, time blocking, hiring help - nothing worked until..."
- Shows natural thought flow

**10. "We" Instead of "You" Sometimes**
- ✅ "Let's walk through this together."
- ✅ "We've all been there."
- More inclusive, less preachy

### DO:
- Speak directly to solo practitioners ("You might be wondering...", "When you...")
- Use frameworks and numbered lists (brain-friendly structure)
- Include realistic examples from solo practice
- Acknowledge challenges without being discouraging
- End with ONE clear action step (not a list)
- Reference books, tools, or resources when relevant
- Share personal experimentation and learning
- **Sound like you're talking to a friend over coffee, not writing an essay**

### DON'T:
- Assume big firm resources or staff
- Use jargon without explaining it
- Make it sound academic or theoretical
- Give advice that only works with a team
- End with vague suggestions like "think about it"
- Make listeners feel behind or inadequate
- **Write in formal, complete, "proper" sentences - that's for essays, not podcasts**
- **Use phrases like "Furthermore," "Additionally," "In conclusion" - too written**

## Example Structure

```
[PROBLEM - 30 seconds]
"You know that feeling when a potential client calls and you've got no idea what to charge? You quote too high - they disappear. Quote too low - you're working for pennies. Sound familiar? Let's fix that today."

[FRAMEWORK - 5 minutes]
"Here's a three-step pricing framework I learned after ten years of trial and error. And honestly? I wish someone had told me this on day one.

Step 1: Calculate your minimum viable rate.

Look, this isn't sexy. But you need to know your floor. Add up office rent, insurance, those student loans, taxes, the salary you actually want to take home. Divide by billable hours. That's your floor. You can't go lower.

Step 2: Research market rates in your area.

Now here's what I did. I checked court filings for fee disputes. I called three colleagues I trusted. I joined the local bar's listserv. Took me maybe two hours. And suddenly I knew what people were actually paying - not what lawyers were hoping to charge.

Step 3: Build your confidence buffer.

You're not charging $175 if the market pays $250. Why? Because you're scared. I get it. I've been there. But here's the thing - your experience has value. Add 10-20% for confidence. You've earned it.

Let me walk through each step with real numbers..."

[EXAMPLE - 90 seconds]
"So here's how this worked for me last month. DUI case.

My minimum rate? $175/hour. Market rate for DUI in my area? $200-300/hour. My experience? Five years criminal defense.

I quoted $250/hour with a $5,000 flat fee for trial prep through verdict. Client said yes immediately. And you know what that told me? I probably priced too low. But I also got data for next time. That's how you learn."

[ACTION - 30 seconds]
"This week, pick one practice area and run the numbers. That's it. Just one. Calculate your minimum rate, research the market, see where you land. I'm betting you'll be surprised how much clarity that brings.

I'm Tony. Thanks for listening to Solo Law Club."

## Topic Examples

**Business/Operations:**
- Pricing strategies

**Mindset/Philosophy:**

## Frameworks to Use

- **Three-step systems** (easiest to remember)
- **Before/After contrasts** ("I used to... Now I...")
- **Decision trees** ("If X, then Y. If not, then Z.")
- **The 80/20 rule** (focus on high-impact actions)
- **Timeline frameworks** (daily, weekly, quarterly, annual)

## Length Guidelines

- **3-5 minutes** = Single tip or hack (450-750 words)
- **5-8 minutes** = Complete framework (750-1200 words)
- **8-12 minutes** = Deep dive with examples (1200-1800 words)

Match length to complexity. Don't pad a simple idea, but don't rush a complex one.

## Example Openings

**Problem identification:**
- "You've been working 60-hour weeks, but your bank account doesn't show it. Let's talk about pricing."
- "A client just asked for a refund. You panicked. What do you do? Today we'll build a client satisfaction protocol."
- "You're drowning in email. There's a better way."

**Book/concept introduction:**
- "I just finished Cal Newport's 'Slow Productivity,' and it changed how I think about case load."
- "James Clear says habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Here's what that means for your practice."

## Example Action Steps

- ❌ "Think about implementing these strategies" (too vague)
- ✅ "This week, track every hour you work. Just track. We'll analyze next episode." (specific, doable)

- ❌ "Improve your client intake process" (too big)
- ✅ "Send a follow-up email to your last three consultations and ask if they had questions." (concrete)

## Resource Mentions

Be specific when recommending:
- **Books**: Full title and author
- **Tools**: Exact product name and why you chose it
- **Templates**: Where to find them or offer to share

Example: "I use Clio for case management because it integrates with LawPay and QuickBooks. It costs $69/month for solo plans."
