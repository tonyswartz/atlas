**Show Notes**:
Let's write an episode about the pros and cons on using LLMs like ChatGPT to travel plan. I did that for the last big trip we took to Portugal and while it wasn't totally accurate, it was a good starting point. It got me basic ideas for cities, travel friendly ideas for seeing each city with a baby, and overall I'd rate it about 8/10 for the overall experience. I tried this a few years ago with almost no success, so the models have come a long way in more accurate info combined with web access to track more updated info than what it was trained with.
