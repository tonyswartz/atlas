### Lifestyle & Wellbeing (from 13 months of journal data)
**Summary:**

The individual maintains a balanced but somewhat irregular lifestyle, characterized by a mix of remote work flexibility and on-site commitments. His energy patterns are generally steady, with notable variability due to family responsibilities, particularly caring for his young son Lincoln. He aims for consistent fitness through cycling and in-line hockey practice, achieving new annual milestones (1865 miles in 2025) but struggles with outdoor ice skating given limited access.

In terms of wellness, he prioritizes mental health by working from home when needed to avoid disruptions caused by last-minute cancellations or stressful family dynamics. He actively seeks ways to improve work-life balance and has recently started daycare for Lincoln, aiming to reduce such disruptions.

Family life is a central theme, with both celebrations (like the Kraken game win) and challenges (Lincoln’s recent cough issues). His goal is to enhance his son's care while maintaining professional success; he recently achieved 150% of his revenue goal ($750k), setting an ambitious $900k target for next year.

Recurring concerns include managing Lincon’s health, particularly when sick, and balancing remote work with in-person client meetings. He also contemplates the long-term benefits of increasing daycare days to provide more consistent care while minimizing health risks. Recurring celebrations involve family milestones (like starting Lincoln at daycare) and professional successes that contribute to a sense of accomplishment and stability.
