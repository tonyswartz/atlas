# Goals Manifest

Index of available goal workflows. Each goal defines: objective, inputs, tools to use, expected outputs, and edge cases.

**How to use:** Before starting a task, check this list for a relevant workflow. If a goal exists, follow it.

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `build_app.md` | Full-stack app build workflow using the ATLAS 5-step process (Architect → Trace → Link → Assemble → Stress-test). |

*Goals are the process layer — they tell the system what to achieve. Only modify or create goals with explicit permission.*
